There was an internal issue processing the transaction — it looks like the private key was misinterpreted. Let me retry the payout now.

There seems to be an issue with how the private key is being processed — it's being incorrectly interpreted as a number instead of a string.

I'll investigate and correct the formatting now to ensure the transaction goes through.

The payout failed due to a backend issue: the private key is being misinterpreted as a BigInt instead of a string. This seems to be a bug on the MCP server's end.

I'll report this problem and update you as soon as it's resolved. Thanks for your patience!
